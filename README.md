# IoT-based-Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System-using-Arduino-and-ESP8266
In this project, we aim to create an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System, where we will assess air quality through a web server using the internet. An alarm will be activated when the air quality falls below a predefined threshold, indicating the presence of harmful gases such as CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3.

The system will display the air quality in parts per million (PPM) on both an LCD screen and a webpage for convenient monitoring.
We have incorporated the MQ135 sensor as the air quality sensor in our project, as it stands out as the optimal choice for monitoring air quality. This sensor excels in detecting a wide range of harmful gases with precise measurements. In this IoT project, pollution levels can be monitored remotely from any location using a computer or mobile device. The versatility of this system allows for installation in various environments, enabling the activation of devices such as exhaust fans or the sending of alert SMS/email notifications when pollution surpasses predefined levels.

Working Explanation:
The MQ135 sensor is appropriate at detecting various gases such as NH3, NOx, alcohol, benzene, smoke, CO2, and others, making it an ideal gas sensor for our Air Quality Monitoring Project. When connected to Arduino, the sensor detects these gases, providing pollution levels in parts per million (PPM). The MQ135 gas sensor outputs voltage levels, necessitating conversion to PPM. To achieve this conversion, we have incorporated a library specifically designed for the MQ135 sensor.
The acceptable air quality level is set at 350 PPM, with an upper limit of 1000 PPM. Once it surpasses 1000 PPM, symptoms like headaches, sleepiness, and a sense of stagnant, stale, stuffy air may occur. If it exceeds 2000 PPM, it can lead to an increased heart rate and various health issues.
When the air quality is below 1000 PPM, both the LCD and webpage will indicate 'Fresh Air.' As soon as the value crosses 1000 PPM, the buzzer initiates a beeping sound, and the LCD and webpage display 'Poor Air, Open Windows.' If the level surpasses 2000 PPM, the buzzer continues to beep, and the LCD and webpage show a warning message: 'Danger! Move to fresh Air.
