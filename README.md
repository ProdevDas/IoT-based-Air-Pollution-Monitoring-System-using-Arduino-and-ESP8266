# IoT-based-Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System-using-Arduino-and-ESP8266
In this project, we aim to create an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System, where we will assess air quality through a web server using the internet. An alarm will be activated when the air quality falls below a predefined threshold, indicating the presence of harmful gases such as CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, and NH3.
